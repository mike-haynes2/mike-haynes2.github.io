Hello there!

Welcome to my personal webpage. I am a graduate researcher in the [School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences]{https://eas.gatech.edu/} at the [Georgia Institute of Technology]{https://gatech.edu/} in Atlanta, Georgia. 



Active Research Interests
======
## Energetic Neutral Atom (ENA) Emissions
My work focuses on developing a method to remotely sense the complex, three-dimensional interactions between magnetized plasmas and obstacles (such as moons or planets) through a more efficient means. Energetic Neutral Atoms (ENAs) are a powerful tool for such remote sensing, since the morphology of ENA emissions is governed by the ambient neutral gas distribution, the ambient energetic ion distribution, and the local magnetic field configuration. As such, these ENAs which propogate along straight trajectories may be imaged, in a sense. Reconstructing the physical nature of the obstacle-plasma interaction through theoretical considerations and numerical modeling is the goal of my work.

In the early 2030s, ESA's [JUICE]{https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Juice} will arrive at the Jovian system and take the first ENA images of the Galilean moons' interactions. In anticipation of this, I am developing the first ever model to self-consistently model the plasma interaction and subsequent ENA emissions from the atmosphere of Europa. Using a hybrid model to determine the field configurations and a particle tracing tool to evolve the propogating energetic ion trajectories, I am able to constrain the influence of key parameters of the system (Pitch Angle Distribution, neutral gas distribution, strength of plasma interaction and/or inductive response) through the observed ENA emissions. 

## Europa
The interaction between Europa and the plasma embedded within the Jovian magnetosphere stimulates a complex physical system that is not yet entirely understood. I utilize an established hybrid plasma model ([AIKEF]{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2010.12.033}) to simulate the magnetized Jovian plasma in the neighborhood of Europa and the resultant perturbations to the electromagnetic fields that develop from the interplay between this plasma and the neutral envelope of the Galilean moon. These simulations can offer context to magnetic field observations and plasma spectrometer readings from spacecraft flybys.



## Callisto
Callisto possesses the second most dense molecular oxygen rich atmosphere in the solar system- can you guess the first!? Given this, and its putative subsurface ocean, the Galilean moon has been a recent interest of the plasma physicists. I am interested in characterizing its highly variable interaction with the Jovian magnetosphere. In contrast to Europa and Io in the inner magnetosphere, Callisto orbits at over 26 Jupiter radii from Jupiter. This results in the magnetic field orientation and plasma conditions at Callisto to vary much more strongly than they do at the other Galilean moons. I have developed a model to apply a combination of particle tracing and hybrid plasma simulations to constrain the variability in ENA emissions at Callisto across its orbit. This work, in preparation for ESA's JUICE mission, will inform ideal spacecraft trajectories for ENA imaging of Callisto's rich interaction. 



## Pluto
After the [New Horizons]{https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/main/index.html} flyby of the dwarf planet in 2015, research studying the heliospheric environment of Pluto was reinvigorated. I have worked to implement the hybrid model at the Pluto system for a project during my first year of graduate school. I am interested in constraining the three-dimensional nature of the plasma interaction during the New Horizons flyby using a joint model of the electromagnetic fields and energetic ion fluxes. The orbital distance, and thus the heliospheric environment of Pluto is highly variable, ranging from 30 AU to nearly 50 AU at aphelion. Since New Horizons only was able to perform a single flyby of the Plutonian system, I am interested in using the knowledge from the flyby to study the environment of Pluto throughout its 248 year orbit.
