In this study, we investigate the low- and high-energy ion precipitation onto Europa’s surface, constraining the effect of the moon’s perturbed electromagnetic environment on particle fluxes. We find that the moon’s interaction with the Jovian plasma drastically affects ion dynamics, and must be considered in future studies that aim to investigate the irradiation of Europa’s potentially habitable surface and subsurface.
